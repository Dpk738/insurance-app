Points To Consider While Choosing Car Insurance
The process of buying car insurance is simple but takes time and quite a bit of research. Tata AIG understands the importance of having a suitable four wheeler insurance policy and offers car insurance policies that cater to varying individual needs and budgets. Below are some points you should consider when you buy car insurance:
 
Decide Insurance Type
While choosing four wheeler insurance, you can choose between a basic third party liability cover and a comprehensive insurance cover. While having a basic third-party insurance cover is a legal compulsion and covers damages caused only to a third party individual or property, a comprehensive car four-wheeler policy offers more extensive cover that offers protection against accidental damage, damages due to loss and theft, natural and man-made disasters and also offers a personal accident cover. We at TATA AIG also provide varied types of car insurance such as Comprehensive Car Insurance Policy, Stand Alone Own Damage Car Insurance Policy, and Third Party Car Insurance Policy. This array of choices so that you can find the car insurance type that best suits you and your car’s needs.
 
Check Policy Coverage
The policy coverage of your car insurance policy will depend mainly on your needs and your budget. Apart from that, your car’s make and model, the area you live in and other factors will affect the policy coverage. While choosing a suitable insurance policy, you can use the Tata AIG car insurance calculator to calculate and compare the coverage of various policies before making an informed decision.
 
Availability of Add-ons
While you buy car insurance online or renew your policy, you can consider extending or enhancing your policy cover with the help of appropriate add-ons. We offer a set of 13 unique add-ons such as Key Replacement, Return to Invoice, Engine Secure and more, that meet various situations outside the scope of your car insurance policy. A selection of the appropriate add-ons in your car insurance policy can provide an all-round protection to your four wheeler.
 
Check Insured Declared Value
The IDV or Insured Declared Value of the car is its current market value. When calculating your car insurance, the IDV is important as it is the amount your car is insured for. In case of “total loss” - complete damage or theft of the car - the policyholder receives the Insured Declared Value when the claim is settled. Always select the IDV carefully as a lower IDV means insufficient compensation in the event of total loss, even though it means lower policy premiums. On the other hand, a higher IDV could mean paying more expensive premiums.
 
Network of Cashless Garages
If you want to repair your car in case of minor or major damages, then you could visit your insurance provider’s network garages to have the damages repaired. By doing so, you can avail of the cashless claims, wherein, the insurer will directly pay the cost of repairs to the garage, and you won’t have to splurge exorbitant amounts on your repairs!
 
Compare Quotes
Tata AIG’s online Car Insurance Calculator makes it easy for you to compare different four-wheeler insurance policies online. Depending on your budget and requirements, you can choose the insurance amount, the add-ons and then compare different plans to find the appropriate one to protect your car.
 
Check Claim Settlement Ratio, review, and service offered
The claim settlement ratio of a company is an important factor to be considered while purchasing your car insurance. If your insurer’s claim settlement ratio is high, it indicates a better chance of your claims being settled on time. Similarly, the service offered by the insurance company directly affects customer loyalty and should be checked before you buy a four-wheeler insurance policy from the company.
